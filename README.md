# CNE_Project
A multithreaded chat server in C++ that supports multiple TCP clients with user registration, login, status tracking, and private messaging. It includes a UDP broadcast mechanism for network discovery and handles user commands like /help, /register, /login, /send, /status, and /getlog.  The server uses:  Winsock (Windows Sockets API) for socket communication.  Select-based I/O multiplexing to manage concurrent clients.  Command-based protocol, with messages prefixed by / and bounded to 255-byte length.  Atomic and thread-safe shutdown, supporting graceful termination via signal handling.  ðŸ”§ Key Features: Fixed-length message protocol with length-prefixing.  Client registration and login with credential checks.  User presence tracking: active/inactive status.  Per-user private messaging via /send <user> <msg>.  UDP broadcast (255.255.255.255) every 60s to announce the server.  Help and log retrieval via /help and /getlog.  Chunked response logic for long server messages.
